Answer:Mental health is an urgent community concern that impacts community life in multiple domains— education, employment, safety, and social cohesion. Observed rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among adults and youth have increased in the U.S. since the rise in social isolation and economic uncertainty due to the pandemic of 2020. These trends are reflected in many communities, particularly low-income neighborhoods and marginalized groups, that are challenged by barriers to accessing timely, affordable, and culturally reliable mental health care when seeking professional help. Increased wait times, inadequate insurance coverage for mental health care, and the stigma associated with help seeking often contribute to not obtaining timely care.

The community impactions are large—untreated mental health issues may lead to increased absenteeism, lost productivity, homelessness, and substance-use crises. Families manage emotional turmoil and diversion of community organizations as they are forced to respond to crisis versus investing in prevention. Law enforcement becomes the safety net in the absence of sound public mental health policy or supporting community resources. Often issues of mental health are addressed by law enforcement, which is both highly taxing on public resources and erodes trust in law enforcement culture in communities. Additionally, untreated mental illness may deepen existing inequities—people in rural areas or poor urban districts have even fewer clinical providers and limited access to social supports, and this worsens the rates of untreated mental health.

Finding an effective civic response to this challenge includes more than simply increasing the number of clinics—it also includes having a coordinated system of prevention and early intervention, and collaboration across sectors. Public administrators can use data to identify exact areas of service need, as well as to embed mental health priorities in housing, education, and workforce development programs; and to work with schools, non-profit, and private businesses to cultivate resilience. Normalizing and destigmatizing conversations about mental health generally, and about access to community-based mental health counseling, tele-mental health, and peer-support services, results in better outcomes for community well-being. Improving the mental health infrastructure is a public health priority but is also a prerequisite of healthy, safe, and equitable communities.
